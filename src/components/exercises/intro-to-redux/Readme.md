The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how much simpler controlling application
state and behavior are with redux.

Please note that functional components should be used whenever possible and that
redux enables us to use them much more frequently.

The goal of this exercise is the same as that of the state-func-props exercise,
but this time using redux.
