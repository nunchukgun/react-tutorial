The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how difficult it can be to work
with React's native state and props management.

The goal of the exercise is to make it so that that card titled "Displayed Message
Text" displays value typed into the text area on the orange card.

Please note that I have demonstrated three separate ways of passing/receiving props
available to components. This was for demonstration purposes only. You may use
the method that you prefer and that is most appropriate for the situation.
